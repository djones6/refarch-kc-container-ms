Component view As the service needs to offer some basic APIs while consuming and producing events, the code has at least three main components: a kafka consumer, a kafka producer, and a HTTP server exposing the REST APIs. The following diagram illustrates the componentes involved in this container manager microservice: A first component is responsible to define and expose APIs via RESTful protocol. It uses the services to delegate business logic implementation. The service component(s) addresses the business logic implementation and references data access object, and event producer. The event handler is a kafka consumer which runs continuously to get container events from the container topic. It invokes the service component. The event producer, produces events of interest to the business function The DAO implement the persistence for the data received as part of the event payload, or API. Container inventory We are providing a tool to publish container created events to the Kafka containers topic. The python code is in the root project refarch-kc under the itg-tests/ContainersPython folder . The addContainer.sh uses our Python docker image to create a container and send it to kafka.

Reefers make an excellent, portable solution to short or long term storage and can be used to ship or truck goods over long distances as they can be plugged into the power station on ships or have it clipped on generators attached. Perishable products must be kept at a controlled temperature, from point of origin to delivery to retailer or pharmacy. The logistics industry refers to this as the \u201ccold chain\u201d and it encompasses both \u201creefers\u201d (refrigerated containers) as well as warehouses, distribution centers and the final storage or holding areas. Throughout this chain the risk of failure is ever-present, meaning there is always a possibility of cargo exceeding permissible or safe temperature levels, even if only briefly. For example, a truck might be stopped without power in desert heat, allowing temperatures in the reefer to rise. Then power is restored and the temperature in the container comes back down, but the product is damaged. When cargo with such as any of those items listed above are exposed to temperatures outside of prescribed limits it can be damaged. In some cases this is evident, such as with bananas, but in other situations, like the transport of vaccines, it may not be apparent that damage has occurred and the vaccine becomes ineffective. For some products, going over temperature, even only briefly, can reduce shelf life dramatically, incurring substantial costs when it cannot be sold. Organizations contracting to ship perishable products often specify the permissible temperature range. However, even if it is possible to show that product was exposed to conditions outside of those contracted, proving where it happened, and thus responsibility, can be much harder. In this section, we discuss possible machine learning models we can train with the help of historical data to predict whether maintainence is required for the reefer container at a certain point in time. Predictive maintenance problem statement The success of predictive maintenance models depend on three main components: having the right data framing the problem appropriately evaluating the predictions properly From a methodology point of view the Data Scientist needs to address the following questions: What type of failure to consider and which one to predict? What kind of failure is happening? slow degradation or instantaneous failure? What could be the relation between a product characteristics and the failure? What kind of measure exist to assess the given characteristic? Which measurements correspond to good functioning and which ones correspond to failure? How often metrics are reported? What question the model should answer? What kind of output should the model give? How long in advance should the model be able to indicate that a failure will occur? What are the business impact to do not predict the failure? and predicting false negative failure? What is the expected accuracy? Reefer problem types: There are multiple different potential issues that could happen to a refrigerator container. We are choosing to model the \"Sensor Malfunctions\" issue: Sensors in the refrigeration unit need to be calibrated and be continuously operational. An example of failure may come from the air sensor making inaccurate readings of temperatures, which lead to sploiled content. A potential reason may come from a faulty calibration, which can go unnoticed for a good time period. It may be diffiult to know if there is an issue. The other common potential issues are: Fluid leaks, like engine oil, coolant liquid. The preassure sensors added to the circuit may help identify preassure lost over time. Faulty belts and hoses. Faulty calibration: A non-calibrated reefer can cool at a slower or faster rate than desired. Damaged Air Chute. Condenser Issues like broken or damaged coils, clamps or bolts missing, and leaks. Door Seals damaged. Blocked air passage: to keep the temperature homogenous inside the reefer. So the question we want to answer is: does the Reefer keep accurate temperature overtime between what is set versus what is measured? Data set Well we do not have data. But we may be able to simulate them. As this is not production work, we should be able to get the end to end story still working from a solution point of view. The historical data need to represent failure, and represent the characteristics of a Reefer container. We can imagine it includes a lot of sensors to get interesting correlated or independant features. The container metrics generated by the simulator is also manually created. The dataset has the following format: ===================== Timestamp, ID, Temperature(celsius), Target_Temperature(celsius), Amp, CumulativePowerConsumption, ContentType, Humidity, CO2, Door_Open, Maintainence_Required, Defrost_Cycle ===================== Modeling techniques The model uses the generated data from three scenarios: When the container's door is open for a longer time - this gives a false positive that maintainence is required. When sensors are malfunctioning, it records arbitrary readings. When the readings are normal. We have currently trained our model on 3000 datapoints from the three scenarios above. There are different modeling approach to tackle predictive maintenance: regression model classification to predict failure for a given time period classify anomalous behavior: classes are not known in advance. Normal operation is known. compute probability of failure over time Code execution The simulator continuosly generates container metrics, publishes it to Kafka and run the predictMaintainence.ipynb to predict if maintainence is sought at this point in time. Simple environment We propose to code a simulator to create the training and test sets so we can build the model inside Jupiter notebook and with sklearn library. The simulator will be also used as an injector to real time events on loaded containers, used to travel goods, so we can trigger a maintenance order process. Here is a diagram for the data scientist environment: For the runtime execution we will plug the model as a consumer of containerMetrics topic which keeps container metrics in the form of event like below, keyed by containerID. { \"timestamp\": 1234567, \"containerID\": \"C10\", } Model description We are using Machine Learning supervised learning here. There are two types of supervised learning - 1) Classification: Predict a categorical response, 2) Regression: Predict a continuous response Linear regression Pros: 1) Fast 2) No tuning required 3) Highly interpretable 4) Well-understood Cons: 1) Unlikely to produce the best predictive accuracy 2) Presumes a linear relationship between the features and response 3) If the relationship is highly non-linear as with many scenarios, linear relationship will not effectively model the relationship and its prediction would not be accurate Naive Bayes classification Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier inspired by the Bayes theorem under a simple assumption which is the attributes are conditionally independent. The classification is conducted by deriving the maximum posterior which is the maximal P(Ci|X) with the above assumption applying to Bayes theorem. This assumption greatly reduces the computational cost by only counting the class distribution. Even though the assumption is not valid in most cases since the attributes are dependent, surprisingly Naive Bayes has able to perform impressively. Naive Bayes is a very simple algorithm to implement and good results have obtained in most cases. It can be easily scalable to larger datasets since it takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers. Naive Bayes can suffer from a problem called the zero probability problem. When the conditional probability is zero for a particular attribute, it fails to give a valid prediction. This needs to be fixed explicitly using a Laplacian estimator. Model evaluation We are using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for evaluating the model performance. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the mean of the squared errors. Classification does better here as the scenarion is more of a classification problem.

The component can be represented in the figure below: The container topics includes all the event about container life cycle. The application is java based and deployed in Liberty packaged into a docker image deployable on kubernetes. The service exposes some RESTful APIs to get a container by ID. No CUD operations as all is done via events. The Streams implementation keeps data in table. As a java based microservice we have two approaches to implement the service: springboot and microprofile. Knowing we will deploy on kubernetes cluster with Istio we will have a lot of the resiliency and scalability addressed for us. But Istio does not support implementing retries logic according to the business logic. Microprofile add a lot of nice capabilities like SSL, open API, JAXRS... Microprofile is supported by Open Liberty as well as many servers. The Apache Kafka Streams API is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters. It simplifies the implementation of the stateless or stateful event processing to transform and enrich data. It supports time windowing processing. We encourage to do this Streams tutorial . The features we want to illustrate in this implementation, using KStreams are: Listen to ContainerAddedToInventory event from the containers topic and maintains a stateful table of containers. Listen to OrderCreated event from orders and assign a container from the inventory based on the pickup location and the container location and its characteristics. Implemented as JAXRS application deployed on Liberty and packaged with dockerfile. Deploy to kubernetes or run with docker-compose Start with maven Kafka streams delivers a Maven archetype to create a squeleton project. The following command can be used to create the base code. mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.kafka -DarchetypeArtifactId=streams-quickstart-java -DarchetypeVersion=2.1.0 -DgroupId=kc-container -DartifactId=kc-container-streams -Dversion=0.1 -Dpackage=containerManager We added a .project file to develop the code in Eclipse, imported the code into Eclipse and modify the .classpath with the following lines: <classpathentry kind=\"con\" path=\"org.eclipse.m2e.MAVEN2_CLASSPATH_CONTAINER\"> <attributes> <attribute name=\"maven.pomderived\" value=\"true\"/> </attributes> </classpathentry> To access to serializer and testing framework we added the following dependencies in the pom.xml: <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId> <artifactId>kafka-clients</artifactId> <version>${kafka.version}</version> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId> <artifactId>kafka-streams-test-utils</artifactId> <version>${kafka.version}</version> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> Using this approach as the service runs in OpenLiberty and integrate JAXRS, microprofile, Open API,... we have to add a lot of depencies into the pom.xml file. Another approach is to use IBM Cloud starter kit. Start with IBM Cloud microprofile starter kit Use the Create resource option and select the \"Java microservice with microprofile and Java EE\" starter kit as shown below: Then enter an application name (e.g. MP-ContainerMS) with a resource group and may be some tags. The next step is to select a kubernetes cluster instance: Configure the toolchain, and verify the application is created in the console: The application is accessible from github, a toolchain is ready to process the app and deploy it. At the time of writting, and most likely in the future too, the steps and the documentations are not aligned. Code is release on a weekly basis and the documentation is often behind. We can download the source code from the github. The address was https://git.ng.bluemix.net/boyerje/MP-ContainerMS. We have to unprotect the master branch so we can push our update. We also have to modify the deployment configuration to change the target namespace. The generated code includes helm chart, Dockerfiles, and base JAXRS code. The code generated is very similar to the one created using the ibmcloud dev CLI. But we need to modify this generated project with some specific microprofile content. Eclipse microprofile is now on version 2.2, so we also use the following code generator from the Microprofile starter site so we can get updated code with new capability like SSL, openAPI and JWT supports. So now we need to integrate both code and then add Kafka streams. Here are some of the main updates we did: Add in the cli-config.yml the registry address and cluster name Change pom dependencies for microprofile 2.2, and change the image in Dockerfile to access websphere liberty 19.0.0.3 compatible with 2.2. (FROM websphere-liberty:19.0.0.3-microProfile2) Use the health class from the microprofile 2.2 generated code, as it uses microprofile annotation. Add also the configuration injection with properties file. Add new package names. Remove unnecessary files * Modify the Values.yaml to reflect the target registry and add secret reference: repository: us.icr.io/ibmcaseeda/mpcontainerms tag: latest pullPolicy: Always pullSecret: browncompute-registry-secret Some of those steps are pushed to the development kubernetes cluster using the command: Some useful Kafka streams APIs The stream configuration looks similar to the Kafka consumer and producer configuration. props.put(StreamsConfig.APPLICATION_ID_CONFIG, \"container-streams\"); props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, \"localhost:9092\"); props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_KEY_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass()); props.put(StreamsConfig.DEFAULT_VALUE_SERDE_CLASS_CONFIG, Serdes.String().getClass()); The StreamsConfig is a specific configuration for Streams app. One of the interesting class is the KStream to manage a stream of structured events. Kstreams represents unbounded collection of immutable events. Two classes are supporting the order and container processing: ContainerInventoryView ContainerOrderAssignment We are using the Streams DSL APIs to do the processing. Here is an example of terminal stream to print what is coming to the orders topic: final StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder(); builder.stream(\"orders\") .foreach((key,value) -> { Order order = parser.fromJson((String)value, OrderEvent.class).getPayload(); // TODO do something to the order System.out.println(\"received order \" + key + \" \" + value); }); final Topology topology = builder.build(); final KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(topology, props); streams.start(); We want now to implement the container inventory. We want to support the following events: ContainerAddedToInventory, ContainerRemovedFromInventory ContainerAtLocation ContainerOnMaintenance, ContainerOffMaintenance, ContainerAssignedToOrder, ContainerReleasedFromOrder ContainerGoodLoaded, ContainerGoodUnLoaded ContainerOnShip, ContainerOffShip ContainerOnTruck, ContainerOffTruck We want the container event to keep a timestamp, a version, a type, and a payload representing the data describing a Reefer container. The Key is the containerID. The java class for the container event is here . Using a TDD approach we will start by the tests to implement the solution. For more information on the Streams DSL API keeep this page slose to you . Test Driven Development We want to document two major test suites. One for building the internal view of the container inventory, the other to support the container to order assignment. Container inventory When the service receives a ContainerAdded event it needs to add it to the table and be able to retreive it by ID To support the Get By ID we are adding a Service class with the operation exposed as RESTful resource using JAXRS annotations. We already described this approach in the fleetms project . To test a stream application without Kafka backbone there is a test utility available here . The settings are simple: get the properties, define the serialisation of the key and value of the event to get from kafka, define the stream process flow, named topology, send the input and get the output. The test TestContainerInventory is illustrating how to use the TopologyTestDriver . Properties props = ApplicationConfig.getStreamsProperties(\"test\"); props.put(StreamsConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, \"dummy:1234\"); TopologyTestDriver testDriver = new TopologyTestDriver( buildProcessFlow(), props); ConsumerRecordFactory<String, String> factory = new ConsumerRecordFactory<String, String>(\"containers\", new StringSerializer(), new StringSerializer()); ConsumerRecord<byte[],byte[]> record = factory.create(\"containers\",ce.getContainerID(), parser.toJson(ce)); testDriver.pipeInput(record); We are using the String default serialization for the key and the ContainerEvent, and use Gson to serialize and deserialize the json. So the test is to prepare a ContainerEvent with type = \"ContainerAdded\" and then get the payload, persist it in the table and access to the table via the concept of store and validate the data. Below is the access to the store and compare the expected results KeyValueStore<String, String> store = testDriver.getKeyValueStore(\"queryable-container-store\"); String containerStrg = store.get(ce.getContainerID()); Assert.assertNotNull(containerStrg); Assert.assertTrue(containerStrg.contains(ce.getContainerID())); Assert.assertTrue(containerStrg.contains(\"atDock\")); Now the tricky part is in the Stream process flow. The idea is to process the ContainerEvent as streams (of String) and extract the payload (a Container), then generate the Container in a new stream, group by the key and then save to a table. We separate the code in a function so e can move it into the real application after. public Topology buildProcessFlow() { final StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder(); // containerEvent is a string, map values help to change the type and data of the inpit values builder.stream(CONTAINERS_TOPIC).mapValues((containerEvent) -> { // the container payload is of interest to keep in table Container c = jsonParser.fromJson((String)containerEvent, ContainerEvent.class).getPayload(); return jsonParser.toJson(c); }).groupByKey() // the keys are kept so we can group by key to prepare for the tabl .reduce((container,container1) -> { System.out.println(\"received container \" + container1 ); return container1; }, Materialized.as(\"queryable-container-store\")); return builder.build(); } The trick is to use the reduce() function that get the container and save it to the store that we can specify. The unit test runs successfully with the command: mvn -Dtest=TestContainerInventory test . This logic can be integrated in a View class. So we can refactor the test and add new class (see ContainerInventoryView class) to move the logic into the applciation. From a design point of view this class is a DAO. Now that we are not using the Testing tool, we need the real streams. In class ContainerInventoryView: private KafkaStreams streams; // .. Properties props = ApplicationConfig.getStreamsProperties(\"container-streams\"); props.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, \"earliest\"); streams = new KafkaStreams(buildProcessFlow(), props); try { streams.cleanUp(); streams.start(); } catch (Throwable e) { System.exit(1); } As illustrated above, the streams API is a continuous running Thread, so it needs to be started only one time. We will address scaling separatly. So we isolate the DAO as a Singleton, and start it when the deployed application starts, via a ServletContextListener. public class EventLoop implements ServletContextListener{ @Override public void contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent sce) { // Initialize the Container consumer ContainerInventoryView cView = (ContainerInventoryView)ContainerInventoryView.instance(); cView.start(); } Now we can add the getById operation, package as a war, deploy it to Liberty. Container to Order Assignment The business logic we want to implement is to get an order with the source pickup city, the type of product, the quantity and the expected pickup date, manage the internal list of containers and search for a container located close to the pickup city from the order. The test to validate this logic is under kstreams/src/test/java/ut/TestContainerAssignment . The story will not be completed if we do not talk about how th application get the order. As presented in the design and order command microservice implementation, when an order is created an event is generated to the orders topic. So we need to add another Streams processing and start the process flow in the context listener. Run tests Recall with maven we can run all the unit tests, one test and skip integration tests. # Test a unique test $ mvn -Dtest=TestContainerInventory test # Skip all tests mvn install -DskipTests # Skip integration test mvn install -DskipITs # Run everything mvn install To start the liberty server use the script: ./script/startLocalLiberty or mvn liberty:run-server docker compose configuration Replace existing springcontainerms declaration to the following containerkstreams: image: ibmcase/kc-containerkstreams:latest hostname: containerkstreams ports: - \"12080:9080\" environment: KAFKA_ENV: ${KAFKA_ENV} KAFKA_BROKERS: ${KAFKA_BROKERS} KAFKA_APIKEY: ${KAFKA_APIKEY} How streams flows are resilient?

The component can be represented in the figure below: The container topics includes all the event about container life cycle. The application is java based and deployed in Liberty packaged into a docker image deployable on kubernetes. The service exposes some RESTful APIs to get a container by ID. No CUD operations as all is done via events. The Streams implementation keeps data in table. As a java based microservice we have two approaches to implement the service: springboot and microprofile. Knowing we will deploy on kubernetes cluster with Istio we will have a lot of the resiliency and scalability addressed for us. But Istio does not support implementing retries logic according to the business logic. Microprofile add a lot of nice capabilities like SSL, open API, JAXRS... Microprofile is supported by Open Liberty as well as many servers. The Apache Kafka Streams API is a client library for building applications and microservices, where the input and output data are stored in Kafka clusters. It simplifies the implementation of the stateless or stateful event processing to transform and enrich data. It supports time windowing processing. We encourage to do this Streams tutorial . The features we want to illustrate in this implementation, using KStreams are: Listen to ContainerAddedToInventory event from the containers topic and maintains a stateful table of containers. Listen to OrderCreated event from orders and assign a container from the inventory based on the pickup location and the container location and its characteristics.

This is another way to implement the same specifications and helps us to assess the different technologies to develop event-driven cloud native microservice. The user stories to support are described in this section . The application is built around the following components: A Postgresql repository to support CRUD operations for Reefer containers A kafka consumer for container events, to get the container data and call the repository to save new container or update existing one. A new Order consumer to get order created event, and then search matching container(s) taking into account the product type, the quantity and the pickup address. It uses the postgresql repository to find the list of Reefer candidates. An order producer to send containerId - Order ID assignment event to the orders topic using order ID as key A container producer to send containerId - Order ID assignment event to the container topic, using container ID as key. Expose RESTful APIs to be a reusable service too. We are addressing one of the characteristics of microservice 'reversibility' with this project: the programming style and deployment to different cloud platform. We try to answer the following questions: How to deploy to IBM Cloud kubernetes service and in one command, taking the same code version and deploying it to IBM Cloud Private behind the firewall with all the related components available on that plaform? How to adopt control the dependencies and the configuration factors (See The 12 factors app ) to facilitate reversibility? Starting code We have found it is necessary to combine different starter code as the basic spring boot generated code is not useful. Start from Spring initializer Using the Spring Code generator we created the base project. The generated code is really minimum and the interesting part is the maven pom.xml dependencies. We do not have code related to the selected dependant, no dockerfile and all the goodies to deploy to Kubernetes cluster. It is more convenient to start from IBM Cloud starter kit and modify the generared pom.xml with the needed dependencies... Start from IBM Cloud Starter Kit. Once logged to IBM Cloud, create a resource and select Starter kit in the Catalog, then the Java microservice with Spring kit. The application is created, we can download the code or create a toolchain so we can use a continuous integration and deployment to an existing IBM Kubernetes Service. Now the code repository has Dockerfile, helm chart, CLI configuration, scripts and other manifests... We can build existing code and run it with the following commands: $ mvn clean package $ java -jar target/SpringContainerMS-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar application.SBApplication Pointing to http://localhost:8080/ will bring the first page. It works! So let break it. If you did not try it before, and if you are using Eclipse last release, you can install Eclipse Spring IDE plugin: open Eclipse Marketplace and search for Spring IDE, and then download release 4.x: To verify the installation, importing our project as a 'maven' project will let you see the different options like spring boot starters election, etc... The tool is also available for IDE visual studio code. See this note for Spring toools. Update pom.xml The generated dependencies include Spring boot starter web code, hystrix for circuit breaker and retries, and testing. We need to add kafka and postgreSQL dependencies and re-run mvn install . <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId> <artifactId>spring-kafka</artifactId> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.postgresql</groupId> <artifactId>postgresql</artifactId> <scope>runtime</scope> </dependency> <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.kafka</groupId> <artifactId>spring-kafka-test</artifactId> <scope>test</scope> </dependency> Some Spring boot basis We encourage you to go over the different tutorials from spring.io. We followed the following ones to be sure we have some good understanding of the basic components: Springboot . Helps to start quickly application. The first class as the main function and run the SpringApplcation. The @SpringBootApplication annotation adds configuration to get the spring bean definitions, and auto configure the bean jars needed. As we specified the pring-boot-starter-web artifact in the dependencoes the application is a web MVC and includes a Dispatcher servlet. Data with JPA addresses creating entity beans, repository as data access object and queries. Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, JPA, Hibernate RESTful CRUD API Example from Callicoder Spring Kafka Add the get /containers API We want to start by the get reefer containers test and then implement a simple container controller bean with the CRUD operations. Spring takes into account the package names to manage its dependencies and settings. The test looks like below: @Test public void testGetContainers() throws Exception { String endpoint = \"http://localhost:\" + port + \"/containers\"; String response = server.getForObject(endpoint, String.class); assertTrue(\"Invalid response from server : \" + response, response.startsWith(\"[\")); } Spring Boot provides a @SpringBootTest annotation to build an application context used for the test. Below we specify to use Spring unit test runner, and to load the configuration from the main application class. The server used above is auto injected by the runner. @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) @SpringBootTest(classes=SBApplication.class,webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT) public class ContainerAPITest { @Autowired private TestRestTemplate server; @LocalServerPort private int port; The next step is to implement the controller class under the package ibm.labs.kc.containermgr.rest.containers . package ibm.labs.kc.containermgr.rest.containers; @RestController public class ContainerController { @GetMapping(\"containers\") public List<ContainerEntity> getAllContainers() { return new ArrayList<ContainerEntity>; } The ContainerEntity is a class with JPA annotations, used to control the object to table mapping. Below is a simple entity definition : @Entity @Table(name = \"containers\") public class ContainerEntity implements java.io.Serializable { @Id protected String id; protected String type; protected String status; protected String brand; } Once we have defined the entity attributes and how it is mapped to the table column, the next major step is to add a repository class: ContainerRepository.java and configure the application to use Postgress dialect so JPA can generate compatible DDLs. The repository is scrary easy, it just extends a base JpaRepository and specifies the primary key used as ID and the type of record as ContainerEntity. @Repository public interface ContainerRepository extends JpaRepository<ContainerEntity,String>{} Spring makes it magic to add save, findById, findAll... operations transparently. So now we can @Autowrite this repository into the controller class and add the integration tests. The test is in the Junit test class: PostgreSqlTest . In fact, for test reason we want to inject Mockup class in unit test via the controller contructor. @Test public void testAccessToRemoteDBSpringDatasource() { Optional<ContainerEntity> cOut = containerRepo.findById(\"c1\"); if (!cOut.isPresent()) { ContainerEntity c = new ContainerEntity(\"c1\",\"Brand\",\"Reefer\",100,0,0); c.setCreatedAt(new Date()); c.setUpdatedAt(c.getCreatedAt()); containerRepo.save(c); // add asserts... } } Finally the controller is integrating the repository: @Autowired private ContainerRepository containerRepository; @GetMapping(\"/containers/{containerId}\") public ContainerEntity getContainerById(@PathVariable String containerId) { return containerRepository.findById(containerId) .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException(\"Container not found with id \" + containerId)); } The test fails as it is missing the configuration to the postsgresql service. As we do not want to hardcode the password and URL end point or share secret in public github we define the configuration using environment variables. See the application.properties file. We have two choices for the Postgresql service: one using IBM Cloud and one running local docker image. To export the different environment variables we have a setenv.sh script (which we have defined a template for named setenv.sh.tmp in the main repository refarch-kc ) with one argument used to control the different environment varaibles for Kafka and Postgresql. The script argument should be one of LOCAL (default if no argument is given), IBMCLOUD, or ICP. To execute against the remote postgresql and Kafka use: # Under the SpringContainerMS folder $ source ../scripts/setenv.sh IBMCLOUD $ mvn test To execute against a local kafka - postesgresql docker images, first you need to start the backend services: In the refarch-kc project, under the docker folder use the docker compose file:backbone-compose.yml (See this note for detail ): $ source ../scripts/setenv.sh LOCAL $ mvn test After the tests run successfully with a valid connection to IBM cloud, launching the spring boot app location and going to http://localhost:8080/containers/c1 will give you the data for the Container \"c1\". Preparing your local test environment We propose to use the local deployment to do unit tests and integration tests. The integration test for this application is quite complex and we propose to use a diagram to illustrate the components involved and how to start them. First be sure your back end services run: It will start zookeeper, kafka and postgresql. You need the refarch-kc main project for that which normally can be in one folder above this current project.

As part of the CI/CD design, there is an important subject to address is how to support integration tests. Unit tests focus on validating the business logic, while integration tests validate the end to end integration of the microservice with its dependants services and products. We separated the unit tests and integration tests in their own Java packages. Later it will be more appropriate to have a separate code repository for integration tests (we stated this approach in the refarch-kc project under the itg-tests folder). Integration tests in this project access remote postegresql server. When the server is in IBM Cloud as part of the postgresql service, a SSL Certificate is defined as part of the service credentials. When building with Docker multi-stage this means the build stage has to get certificate in the Java TrustStore so tests are successful. We burnt a lot of time on this one to make it working. We recommend reading the security section below to see what commands to run to get certificate in good format and create a truststore. Those commands have to be done in the dockerfile too and certificate, URL, user, password has to be injected using Dockerfile arguments and then environment variables. See the scripts/buildDocker.sh to assess the docker build parameters used. And then how to manage the certificate creation into the Java TrustStore using scripts like add_certificates.sh . This script needs to be executed before the maven build so any integration tests that need to access the remote Postgresql server will not fail with SSL handcheck process. And it needs to be done in the docker final image as part of the startup of the spring boot app (see startup.sh ). Listening to container events The use story is to get the container event from the kafka containers topics and add new Reefer container data to the inventory, or update existing container. So we need to add consumer and publisher using Spring Kafka . Spring Kafka template is based on the pure java kafka-clients jar but provides the same encapsulation as Spring JMS template. Here is the product documentation . First we need to start a kafka consumer when the application starts. We want one unique instance, so a singleton. As presented in this article , we select to add a Component that is an application listener (Annotation @EventListener) so when the spring context is running, we can start consuming message from Kafka. @Component public class ContainerConsumer { @EventListener public void onApplicationEvent(ContextRefreshedEvent event) { // prepare kafka consumer, add an event handler callback and start the consumer } The code is in the class: ibm.labs.kc.containermgr.kafka.ContainerConsumer.java . Spring Kafka container](https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/2.2.4.RELEASE/reference/#receiving-messages) is not bringing that much value on top of Kafka Java API, and we prefer learning a unique API and keep programming with the Kafka Java API. We have added an end to end integration test to create container events and see the payload persisted in Postgresql. When running the server locally, you may want to leverage our docker compose file to start a local kafka broker. Listening to Order Event The approach is the same as above and the supporting class is: ibm.labs.kc.containermgr.kafka.OrderConsumer . The difference is in the search for container for the order: Security To communicate with IBM Cloud PostgresSQl service the client needs to use SSL certificates... First to avoid sharing userid and password in github, we use environment variables for postgressql url, user and password. There is a setenv.tmpl.sh in the scripts folder to use with your own settings. Rename it setenv.sh . This file is ignored by git. The values are coming from the IBM Cloud postgresql service. Also to run unit test in eclipse you need to set those environment variables in the run configuration as illustrated in the figure below: Those variables are used the Spring boot application.configuration file, for example for the postgresql URL: spring.datasource.url=${POSTGRESQL_URL} When the Spring repository class establishes a TLS or SSL communication to the Postgresql service in IBM Cloud (or ICP), both client and server negotiate a stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure. During this procedure, the server usually sends back its identification in the form of a digital certificate. Java programs store certificates in a repository called Java KeyStore (JKS). To create the SSL connection you will need to make the server public certificate available to your Java client JVM. The certificate is persisted in a Trustore. So get the server public certificate: postgresql.crt , then convert it to a form Java understands. To download a text version of the base64 certificate as defined in the connection credentials of the IBM Cloud postgressql service use the following command: $ ibmcloud cdb deployment-cacert Green-DB-PostgreSQL # if you do not have the cloud database plugin does the following and rerun previous command: $ ibmcloud plugin install cloud-databases Save the certificate to a file (e.g. postgressql.crt). Then transform it to a Java format and save it to a keystore used by Java # transform $ openssl x509 -in postgressql.crt -out postgressql.crt.der -outform der # save in keystore $ keytool -keystore clienttruststore -alias postgresql -import -file postgressql.crt.der -storepass changeit Then adding the following setting will let the Java program accesses the certificates from the keystore. java -jar -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=clienttruststore -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit ./target/SpringContainerMS-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar application.SBApplication We recommend reading this section of Postgresql product documentation, and this article from Baeldung on SSL handshake in Java. Now to make all this available in docker container we propose to let the previous two commands run within the Dockerfile during the build process. Manually deploy to IKS The steps are the same as other project and we are providing the same type of tools: login to IBM Cloud - Adapt to your region. ibmcloud login -a https://api.us-east.bluemix.net connect to the IKS cluster ibmcloud ks region-set us-east ibmcloud ks cluster-config fabio-wdc-07 Define the Kube config variable so all the kubectl and helm commands will contact the good cluster. export KUBECONFIG= ~/.bluemix/plugins/container-service/clusters/fabio-wdc-07/kube-config-wdc07-fabio-wdc-07.yml login to the private registry ibmcloud cr login build the application jar and docker image using our script ./script/buildDocker.sh IBMCLOUD Push the docker image to the private registry docker push us.icr.io/ibmcaseeda/kc-springcontainerms Deploy the Helm release ./scripts/deployHelm which is equivalent to the command: helm install $chart/ --name $kname --namespace $ns If for any reason you get a \"image can't be pulled\" error. Verify the image is in the private registry with the command: docker cr image-list Then if the image exists, verify there is a secret defined to keep the security key to access the registry in the same namespace as you are deploying your app, and this secret is referenced in the yaml file: \"imagePullSecrets\": [ { \"name\": \"browncompute-registry-secret\" } ], Perform integration tests from local to remote IBM Cloud deployment As presented in the section above , we have a set of tools that can create container, orders and verify the code is running well in its complete deployed environment. The same scripts can be run with the IBMCLOUD argument. So below is the list of command to perform on you laptop while the Spring boot app is deployed on IKS, using Event Streams and Postgresql on IBM Cloud: Start a container consumer to trace the execution: in the folder refarch-kc/itg-tests/ContainersPython . It listens to get a container with id: \"ic-c01\" ./runContainerConsumer.sh IBMCLOUD ic-c01 Run a producer of container events to add a new container into the inventory: in the same folder refarch-kc/itg-tests/ContainersPython ./addContainer.sh IBMCLOUD ic-c01 Start an order consumer, to trace the traffic: in the folder refarch-kc/itg-tests/OrdersPython ./runOrderConsumer.sh IBMCLOUD order01 Create an order from the same folder: refarch-kc/itg-tests/OrdersPython addOrder.sh LOCAL order01 Going to the web URL of the container service you should see the container added. Encountered issues with some solution The level of abstraction in Spring is nice when doing basic things but can become a nightmare when doing real bigger application including different libraries. Also migrating or using the last version 2.xx, bring changes to existing code and tests. Below is a list of iisues we spent time on: When JPA started, it creates / updates database schema, and for example enforced to have an Id as int while it was as string. As a bypass we create the table before in postsgresql using psql tool. When starting the spring data, JPA will try to connect to the PostgresSQL and execute a set of validation, one of them could generate the following exception: Method org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection.createClob() is not yet implemented . The explanation for the solution is here Testing endpoint /health did not work on Spring 2.1.4. Thisi s due that there is the new Actuator capabilities ( spring-boot-starter-actuator ) that adds endpoints to manage a webapp in production. This is a nice feature. So remove any hold Health api class and modify the url to /actuator/health . Be sure to read this note on actuator. Deployed in Kubernetes service, the pod has issue on postgress SSL handshake. (org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: SSL error: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure). SSL handshakes are a mechanism by which a client and server establish the trust and logistics required to secure their connection over the network. This problem may be linked to a SSL certificate not found or wrong encryption protocol. We need to be sure a Java Keystore is defined and includes the public certificate coming from the server. See security section above. When deploying to IKS, we did see an exception about container topics not visible . This problem is coming from the fact that we are using Event Stream simplest deployment, which is multi tenants. And even if our code reach the brokers, our api key was wrong so we could get to another instance which did not have our topics. Be sure the api key is well defined in the kubernetes secret.

Spring takes into account the package names to manage its dependencies and settings. The test looks like below: @Test public void testGetContainers() throws Exception { String endpoint = \"http://localhost:\" + port + \"/containers\"; String response = server.getForObject(endpoint, String.class); assertTrue(\"Invalid response from server : \" + response, response.startsWith(\"[\")); } Spring Boot provides a @SpringBootTest annotation to build an application context used for the test. Below we specify to use Spring unit test runner, and to load the configuration from the main application class. The server used above is auto injected by the runner. @RunWith(SpringRunner.class) @SpringBootTest(classes=SBApplication.class,webEnvironment = WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT) public class ContainerAPITest { @Autowired private TestRestTemplate server; @LocalServerPort private int port; The next step is to implement the controller class under the package ibm.labs.kc.containermgr.rest.containers . package ibm.labs.kc.containermgr.rest.containers; @RestController public class ContainerController { @GetMapping(\"containers\") public List<ContainerEntity> getAllContainers() { return new ArrayList<ContainerEntity>; } The ContainerEntity is a class with JPA annotations, used to control the object to table mapping. Below is a simple entity definition : @Entity @Table(name = \"containers\") public class ContainerEntity implements java.io.Serializable { @Id protected String id; protected String type; protected String status; protected String brand; } Once we have defined the entity attributes and how it is mapped to the table column, the next major step is to add a repository class: ContainerRepository.java and configure the application to use Postgress dialect so JPA can generate compatible DDLs. The repository is scrary easy, it just extends a base JpaRepository and specifies the primary key used as ID and the type of record as ContainerEntity. @Repository public interface ContainerRepository extends JpaRepository<ContainerEntity,String>{} Spring makes it magic to add save, findById, findAll... operations transparently. So now we can @Autowrite this repository into the controller class and add the integration tests. The test is in the Junit test class: PostgreSqlTest . In fact, for test reason we want to inject Mockup class in unit test via the controller contructor. @Test public void testAccessToRemoteDBSpringDatasource() { Optional<ContainerEntity> cOut = containerRepo.findById(\"c1\"); if (!cOut.isPresent()) { ContainerEntity c = new ContainerEntity(\"c1\",\"Brand\",\"Reefer\",100,0,0); c.setCreatedAt(new Date()); c.setUpdatedAt(c.getCreatedAt()); containerRepo.save(c); // add asserts... } } Finally the controller is integrating the repository: @Autowired private ContainerRepository containerRepository; @GetMapping(\"/containers/{containerId}\") public ContainerEntity getContainerById(@PathVariable String containerId) { return containerRepository.findById(containerId) .orElseThrow(() -> new ResourceNotFoundException(\"Container not found with id \" + containerId)); } The test fails as it is missing the configuration to the postsgresql service. As we do not want to hardcode the password and URL end point or share secret in public github we define the configuration using environment variables. See the application.properties file. We have two choices for the Postgresql service: one using IBM Cloud and one running local docker image. To export the different environment variables we have a setenv.sh script (which we have defined a template for named setenv.sh.tmp in the main repository refarch-kc ) with one argument used to control the different environment varaibles for Kafka and Postgresql. The script argument should be one of LOCAL (default if no argument is given), IBMCLOUD, or ICP. To execute against the remote postgresql and Kafka use: # Under the SpringContainerMS folder $ source ../scripts/setenv.sh IBMCLOUD $ mvn test To execute against a local kafka - postesgresql docker images, first you need to start the backend services: In the refarch-kc project, under the docker folder use the docker compose file:backbone-compose.yml (See this note for detail ): $ source ../scripts/setenv.sh LOCAL $ mvn test After the tests run successfully with a valid connection to IBM cloud, launching the spring boot app location and going to http://localhost:8080/containers/c1 will give you the data for the Container \"c1\".","title":"Add the get /containers  API"},{"location":"springboot/#preparing-your-local-test-environment","text":"We propose to use the local deployment to do unit tests and integration tests.

As part of the CI/CD design, there is an important subject to address is how to support integration tests. Unit tests focus on validating the business logic, while integration tests validate the end to end integration of the microservice with its dependants services and products. We separated the unit tests and integration tests in their own Java packages. Later it will be more appropriate to have a separate code repository for integration tests (we stated this approach in the refarch-kc project under the itg-tests folder). Integration tests in this project access remote postegresql server. When the server is in IBM Cloud as part of the postgresql service, a SSL Certificate is defined as part of the service credentials. When building with Docker multi-stage this means the build stage has to get certificate in the Java TrustStore so tests are successful. We burnt a lot of time on this one to make it working. We recommend reading the security section below to see what commands to run to get certificate in good format and create a truststore. Those commands have to be done in the dockerfile too and certificate, URL, user, password has to be injected using Dockerfile arguments and then environment variables. See the scripts/buildDocker.sh to assess the docker build parameters used. And then how to manage the certificate creation into the Java TrustStore using scripts like add_certificates.sh . This script needs to be executed before the maven build so any integration tests that need to access the remote Postgresql server will not fail with SSL handcheck process. And it needs to be done in the docker final image as part of the startup of the spring boot app (see startup.sh ).","title":"Build with docker"},{"location":"springboot/#listening-to-container-events","text":"The use story is to get the container event from the kafka containers topics and add new Reefer container data to the inventory, or update existing container. So we need to add consumer and publisher using Spring Kafka . Spring Kafka template is based on the pure java kafka-clients jar but provides the same encapsulation as Spring JMS template. Here is the product documentation . First we need to start a kafka consumer when the application starts. We want one unique instance, so a singleton. As presented in this article , we select to add a Component that is an application listener (Annotation @EventListener) so when the spring context is running, we can start consuming message from Kafka. @Component public class ContainerConsumer { @EventListener public void onApplicationEvent(ContextRefreshedEvent event) { // prepare kafka consumer, add an event handler callback and start the consumer } The code is in the class: ibm.labs.kc.containermgr.kafka.ContainerConsumer.java . Spring Kafka container](https://docs.spring.io/spring-kafka/docs/2.2.4.RELEASE/reference/#receiving-messages) is not bringing that much value on top of Kafka Java API, and we prefer learning a unique API and keep programming with the Kafka Java API.

First to avoid sharing userid and password in github, we use environment variables for postgressql url, user and password. There is a setenv.tmpl.sh in the scripts folder to use with your own settings. Rename it setenv.sh . This file is ignored by git. The values are coming from the IBM Cloud postgresql service. Also to run unit test in eclipse you need to set those environment variables in the run configuration as illustrated in the figure below: Those variables are used the Spring boot application.configuration file, for example for the postgresql URL: spring.datasource.url=${POSTGRESQL_URL} When the Spring repository class establishes a TLS or SSL communication to the Postgresql service in IBM Cloud (or ICP), both client and server negotiate a stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure. During this procedure, the server usually sends back its identification in the form of a digital certificate. Java programs store certificates in a repository called Java KeyStore (JKS). To create the SSL connection you will need to make the server public certificate available to your Java client JVM. The certificate is persisted in a Trustore. So get the server public certificate: postgresql.crt , then convert it to a form Java understands. To download a text version of the base64 certificate as defined in the connection credentials of the IBM Cloud postgressql service use the following command: $ ibmcloud cdb deployment-cacert Green-DB-PostgreSQL # if you do not have the cloud database plugin does the following and rerun previous command: $ ibmcloud plugin install cloud-databases Save the certificate to a file (e.g. postgressql.crt). Then transform it to a Java format and save it to a keystore used by Java # transform $ openssl x509 -in postgressql.crt -out postgressql.crt.der -outform der # save in keystore $ keytool -keystore clienttruststore -alias postgresql -import -file postgressql.crt.der -storepass changeit Then adding the following setting will let the Java program accesses the certificates from the keystore. java -jar -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=clienttruststore -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=changeit ./target/SpringContainerMS-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar application.SBApplication We recommend reading this section of Postgresql product documentation, and this article from Baeldung on SSL handshake in Java.

As a bypass we create the table before in postsgresql using psql tool. When starting the spring data, JPA will try to connect to the PostgresSQL and execute a set of validation, one of them could generate the following exception: Method org.postgresql.jdbc.PgConnection.createClob() is not yet implemented . The explanation for the solution is here Testing endpoint /health did not work on Spring 2.1.4. Thisi s due that there is the new Actuator capabilities ( spring-boot-starter-actuator ) that adds endpoints to manage a webapp in production. This is a nice feature. So remove any hold Health api class and modify the url to /actuator/health . Be sure to read this note on actuator. Deployed in Kubernetes service, the pod has issue on postgress SSL handshake. (org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: SSL error: Received fatal alert: handshake_failure). SSL handshakes are a mechanism by which a client and server establish the trust and logistics required to secure their connection over the network. This problem may be linked to a SSL certificate not found or wrong encryption protocol. We need to be sure a Java Keystore is defined and includes the public certificate coming from the server. See security section above. When deploying to IKS, we did see an exception about container topics not visible . This problem is coming from the fact that we are using Event Stream simplest deployment, which is multi tenants. And even if our code reach the brokers, our api key was wrong so we could get to another instance which did not have our topics. Be sure the api key is well defined in the kubernetes secret.
